# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview

The **Sandwich Club** app shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers.

## Objectives
Through this project:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## Project Completion

Downloaded the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

Designed the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implemented the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI.
