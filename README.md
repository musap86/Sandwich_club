# Sandwich Club Project
* Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project

## Project Overview

The **Sandwich Club** app shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Objectives
Through this project:
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## Project Completion

Download the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI.
